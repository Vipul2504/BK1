He founded Lamborghini because he wanted to build sports cars to compete against Ferraris. In 1963, he released a first prototype of his ideal sports car, the 350 GTV.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Speed is the key</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The engine is a development of the Aventador's 6.5-litre V12 and generates a power output of 750 PS (552 kW; 740 hp) at 8,400 rpm and 690 N⋅m (509 lb⋅ft) of torque at 5,500 rpm. The increase in power was achieved by enlarging the air intakes and modifying the exhaust system.[4][5]

            The Veneno is Lamborghini's interpretation of a racing prototype built for the road. The front of the car is designed for maximum airflow and improved downforce. The redesigned front and rear arches direct air around the car in order to reduce excessive lift and aid in generating downforce. </p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Design and performance</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The design of the Veneno is a large departure from the previous styling of Lamborghini models. The design is inspired by Sports prototypes and racing cars. The Y-shaped design elements are a carryover from the Aventador's design language while the rear wheel arches hark back to the Countach. The vented engine cover improves cooling to the engine, while the extreme aerodynamic elements present on the car signify its track-focused characteristics.</p>
        
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> 
            The Lamborghini Veneno has a top speed of 356 km/h (221 mph) and has a 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) acceleration time of 2.8 seconds. The car has a braking distance of 30 m (98.0 ft) from 97–0 km/h (60–0 mph), and can produce 1.41 G while cornering.</p>
